# Business Gatsby 

A PWA (progressive web application) built with Gatsby to showcase key developer skills. The application is capable of being added to a home screen, and key pages are cached for better user experience. A simple push notification on content updates has been implemented. 

I added [Tinker](https://github.com/jvkrakowski/Tinker), [Ask](https://github.com/jvkrakowski/Ask), and [Sorti](https://github.com/jvkrakowski/Sorti). 

## Changes
